            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IN the begining of this chapter (men and brethren beloved in Chriſt) the Apoſtle, that was the author of this epiſtle, exhorteth the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> or <hi>Iewes,</hi> to whom he writeth, to conſider Chriſt Ieſus, the Apoſtle, &amp; high Prieſt, as he faith, of our profeſſion of Chrſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme; &amp; he compareth him with that great and renowned Prophet of God, <hi>Moſes;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>lewes</hi> did magniſie the remebrance

                  <p>And alſo it is recorded in the Actes of the Apoſtles that <hi>manye thouſande levves</hi>

And therefore as the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, in this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is moſt forcible to perſwade the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing to receiue the grace of God in Chriſt; ſo is it moſt neceſſarie to keepe and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the weake members in the ſinceritie of the Goſpell, and to teach them to forſake the ceremonies and earthly rudiments now abrogated and taken away by the death of the Meſſias.

                  <p>There is therefore an illumination, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning <note place="margin">4 Kindes of faith.</note> of ſome mens mindes, to conſent to the doctrine of the Goſpell, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it for the infallible truth of God: for in the goſpel they that ar on the ſtones, which <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 20. 21.

This beleefe, or faith for a time is commonly called, <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> faith, becauſe it is not permanent, nor effectuall to iuſtification, but it is a faith that reprobates haue that are yet in the ſtate of condemnation. There is alſo a gift of doinge Miracles, which an vngodlie or reprobate man may haue: and this is called, <hi>the faith of miracles:</hi> of the which <note place="margin">1.

For this word, <hi>iuſtification,</hi> is the contrary to <hi>condemnation:</hi> and without Chriſt it is manifeſt that all men are in the ſtate of condemnation, as it is written, <hi>like vviſe then as by the offence of one, the fault came <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 18.</note> on all men to condemnation, ſo by the iuſtifying if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3103:30"/>
againe, <hi>being now iuſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaued from wrath through him.</hi> Thus we ſee <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 9.</note> how the faith that iuſtifieth differeth from other faithes, which reprobate men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are ſaid to haue.

                  <p>But, in that we are ſaid to be <hi>made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſt</hi> by a right faith, we are further to note two thinges in the vertue and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this faith that iuſtifieth.

                  <p>Touching the aſſurance of our ſaluation, we are ſure to be ſaued, becauſe we beleeue, and are ſurely Perſwaded that the price of our redemption is <note n="*" place="margin">Chriſt hath in his owne perſon ſuſtere whatſoever was due to our ſins, &amp; hath therby fully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So Chriſt, being the good ſhepheard, did giue his own <hi>life</hi> for the life of <hi>his ſheepe.</hi> And <note place="margin">10. 10. 11. Gal. 3. 13.</note> thereby <hi>hath redeemed vs from the curſe of the law, when he was made a curſe for vs.</hi>

                  <p>For the plainer vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of this ſo great a miſterie, marke a familiar ſimilitude.

                  <p>The third kind of ſinne, is, <hi>a ſinne of malice,</hi> or <hi>a ſinne</hi> of diſobedience to the trueth of God, when they that haue experience of Gods fauour, and goodneſſe towards them, and know his word to be the rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, will not for all that forſake their owne waies to followe it, and to obey it.

                  <p>This ſinne of maliciouſe frowardnes, &amp;

diſobedience to the word of God, is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt fearefull, &amp; is therefore called <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>
